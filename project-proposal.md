## Project Description

Our project, **Deal Finder Site**, is a web application that helps users discover and share product deals. Users can create an account, post products with links to external sites like Amazon or Best Buy, and browse deals shared by others. The app will allow users to search, sort, and filter deals to find what interests them most. Each listing will link to the original site where the item can be purchased.

---

## Planned Features

Deal finder site:
- [ ] Deployment
- [ ] Users create accounts
- [ ] Can post products which link to product descriptions on other sites
- [ ] Users can search for products and click through to purchase on external site
- [ ] Search functionality groups similar products, can sort search by various criteria (e.g. date posted)
- [ ] Only user who posted deal can edit it, can delete it

## APIs

We plan to explore the following APIs, depending on project feasibility:

- **Best Buy API** – free tier for product information
- **Amazon Product Advertising API** – product data and affiliate links

If the APIs are too complex or limited, users can manually post deals without API integration.

## Team Collaboration Plan

### Web Development Experience

Both team members have limited web development experience. We plan to split the work evenly, learn together, and pair program for challenging parts. Tasks will be divided by features instead of skill difficulty to ensure balanced learning and contribution.

### Meeting Schedule

**Regular Meeting Time**: Fridays, 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM  
**Location**: Rush Building, Academic Building, or Library

### Communication

**Primary Channel**: Discord  
**Purpose**: Daily updates, quick questions, and sharing resources.

### Task Management

**Tool**: GitHub Projects  
**Process**: Create issues, assign tasks, and track progress through To Do, In Progress, and Done columns.

### Potential Obstacles

Both of us have heavy course loads and are also working on senior projects. To handle this, we'll set realistic weekly goals, communicate early if one person is busy, and keep tasks small to maintain steady progress.

### Time Commitment

**Total**: 6–8 hours per week for the team  
**Individual**: 3–4 hours per week each  
**Breakdown**: 1 hour for meetings, 2–3 hours for development, testing, and review.

### Workload Distribution

We plan for an even 50/50 split in responsibilities. If one person becomes busier in a particular week, the other will take on a bit more, with the understanding that the workload will balance out later.

### Accountability Plan

If someone falls behind:
1. Check in casually on Discord.
2. Discuss during the Friday meeting.
3. If issues continue, contact the instructor for advice.

## Development Timeline

We'll start with basic posting and searching features, then move to user accounts and advanced search once the core app works. A detailed timeline will be added later.

## Getting Started

Set-up and run instructions will be added once we have our first working version.
